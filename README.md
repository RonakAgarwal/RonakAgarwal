## About Me
I'm Ronak Agarwal, a junior computer science undergraduate with a business minor at the University of Maryland, College Park. This profile contains some of the personal projects I have worked on over the past year with a focus on financial technology, machine learning, and web development. 

## Projects

### 1. Single Family Home Investment Tool

This project initially started as a simple analysis used to find the most investable single family homes in the greater metropolitan area of my hometown - Charlotte, North Carolina. I eventually decided to expand it to a web tool in which any potential investor can enter their location and desired investment requirements and get a similar analysis for their own use. The application uses a real estate API via python to source single family housing data for any area and sorts the results by the ratio of the expected rent price to the listing price of the house. This essentially lets investors see which houses in their area would give them the best return for their money. The application also includes a map with the houses displayed on it, and pictures of the houses from their individual listings. 

### 2. International Fixed Rate Investment Analysis

One of the things I noticed when travelling to India with my family is that the interest rate on fixed rate deposits over there are much much higher than the interest rates for similar investments (Certificate of Deposit) in America. Since I am an OCI (Overseas Citizen of India) card holder, I was intrigued by this as I could probably make a fair bit of money from investing in Indian banks in the future. However, I was skeptical of this as the exchange rate between the US Dollar and Indian rupee is and has been steadily changing in favor of the dollar over time. 

Because of this, I made an analysis using a machine learning regression model to predict the future exchange rate between the Rupee and the Dollar, and compared the investments over a 10 year period of time to see which would yield greater returns. Interestingly enough, the investment in India was predicted to have a much greater yield than the investment in America. 

### 3. Personal Photoblog

This is a blog that I have been running since around 2018 which shows the photos from the places I have travelled to around the world. Currently includes the Canadian Rockies, as well as several national parks around Utah, Colorado, and Arizona.
